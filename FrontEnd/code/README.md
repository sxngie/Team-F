# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Before Installation

You should have [Node.JS, npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed, If not then follow the provided links to install the proper versions.

## Installation

**Make sure you are in the right directory in the terminal! You should be in the projects directory, in this case `semester-project-team-f\FrontEnd\code`**

To get started with this project you will need to run the following commands:

### `npm ci`

This will fetch all the dependencies. We pref

### `yarn sass-install`

Will download and install the Sass binaries.

## Environment Variables

To run this program you need to have a file named `.env.local` which will contain all of the react environment variables. Every variable should start with "**REACT*APP***" followed by the name of the variable you wish to have. A list of the currently used variables below:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |

`To be announced`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back! DO NOT USE THIS!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
